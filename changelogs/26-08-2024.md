# Bite changelog 26.08.2024
- Objects can now define constructors and initialize their superclasses like classes

Before:
```
object Foo : Bar(10) {
    foo = 5;
}
```
After:
```
object Foo : Bar {
    foo = 5;
    # Note: object constructors must not declare any arguments!
    init() : super(10) {
        print("initalizing Foo");
    }
}
```
- Trait usage is now declared in class or trait header

Before:
```
trait Foo {
    using Bar;
}

class Baz {
    using Foo;
}
```
After:
```
trait Foo using Bar {
}

class Baz using Foo {
}
```
