# Bite changelog 16.08.2024
- Added a new semantic analysis step to the compiler
- Rewrote compiler backend to support this step
- As a result compiler is now more resilient and provides more useful error messages
- Fixed some bugs with variable binding
- Added a new global scope for variables
```
fun a() {
    b(); # now legal, global variables are hoisted
}

fun b() {
    print("foo");
}
```
