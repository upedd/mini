# Bite changelog 13.07.2024

- Added classes and inheritance.
```
class Foo {
    get_six() {
        return 6;
    }
}

class Bar : Foo {
    add(int a) {
        return a + this.b + super.get_six();
    }
}

let instance = Bar();
instance.get_six(); # calls Foo.get_six()

instance.b = 10;
instance.b; # classes have fields!

instance.add(4); # expect 20
```
- Added compound assignments.
```
let x = 10;
x *= 10;
x += 12;
x &= 0b1010;
```
- Added native functions.
```c++
// define function in c++
vm.add_native_function("print", [](const std::vector<Value>& args) {
    std::cout << args[1].to_string() << '\n';
    return nil_t;
});    
```
```
native print; # declare that native method should exits

let x = 10;
print(x); # call it!!!
```
- Completely refactored gc code, and now it actually works and doesn't cause any crashes.
- Refactored tons of other code and fixed a lots of bugs.
