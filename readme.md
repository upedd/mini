# Bite ✨
Bite (formerly mini) is a multi-paradigm dynamically typed scripting language
made to be fun and easy to use and embed into other applications.

Made to be used in bite-100 fantasy console (soon™) but is versatile enough that
can be used in other applications as well.

## Features

- Easy to embed into c++ applications
- Writen using very modern c++ 
- Modern and clean syntax
- Fast enough for a scripting language
- Well documented and structured implementation

## Taste of Bite
```
# lines starting with # are comments

# variables are defined using "let" keyword
let awesomeness = 10; # integers
let bugs = 4.5; # floating point numbers
let review = "best language ever"; # strings
```
